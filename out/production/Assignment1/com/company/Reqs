Build a Java console app that manages student enrolment.

1. Student class: id, name, birthdate

2. Course class: id, name, number of credits

3. StudentEnrollment class: student, course, semester (2018A, 2018B etc)

This is an associate class. To keep all enrollments, there must be a list that keeps all enrollments.

You are supposed to define an interface StudentEnrollmentManager to take care of this list. Refer to the lectures on class relationship and interface.

4. Build functionality to enroll students in courses.

This functionality will basically add/update/delete into StudentEnrollment list.

There will be an academic assistant who will use this functionality to enroll students in courses.

The system should ask id of students, course, and semester that students need to enroll (use Scanner(System.in))

There must be functionality to update an enrollment, delete an enrollment as well as show all current enrollments and enrollment of a particular student.

5. Print enrollment details for each student. Print enrollment for all students for 1 semester.

6. When starting the program, sample students and courses should be populated. There is no need to build CRUD functionality for student and course

7. Use at least 10 design patterns for this application. The following patterns must be used:

- Singleton

- Builder

- Visitor

- Chain of responsibilities

- Command

Write a Readme.txt file to describe all the patterns you use.
